# tris-shopify-webpack-boilerplate

This boilerplate is great for working with Shopify from scratch as well as migrating existing Shopify themes and building overtop of them.


## Usage

Use [Themekit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/) to pull down a theme from Shopify and then...

* `npm install`
* `npm run watch` will watch and bundle both the scripts and styles into shopify assets folder
* `npm run watchall` will do the above *and* run `theme watch` all at once
* `npm run build` will build/bundle minified js but the scss.liquid will still stay unoptimized for Shopify to handle
